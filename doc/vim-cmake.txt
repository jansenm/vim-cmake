INTRODUCTION                                    *ref-cmake-introduction* {{{1

This plugin adds cmake support to the following plugins:

    - vim-ref       Integrated reference viewer.
                    https://github.com/thinca/vim-ref

    - neocomplcache Ultimate auto-completion system for Vim.
                    https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplcache

    - unite.vim     Ultimate interface to unite all sources
                    https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim (via vim-ref)

Or in less words. It provides a cmake reference and an auto completion system
that hooks into neocomplcache.

The information is acquired from the cmake executable found on $PATH.

=============================================================================
USAGE                                                  *ref-cmake-usage* {{{1

The plugin does not provide any kind of interface by itself. To use its
functionality you have to use one of the following plugins:

CMAKE REFERENCE~

Using the vim-ref plugin - see|ref-introduction|- which allows command line
completion.
 >
  :Ref cmake [keyword]

Using the unite plugin see -|unite-introduction|- which has quite some nice
ways of handling its sources.
>
  :Unite ref/cmake

CMAKE AUTOCOMPLETION~

CMake autocompletion is provided by hooking into neocomplcache if the filetype
is 'cmake'. See|neocomplache-introduction|for further informaation.
